# Chinese Remainder Theorem

In this document, I try to teach ChatGPT to solve the Chinese Remainder Theorm.

## Problem

There are some apples on the table. If we count them by 3, we have 2 left over; by 5, we have 3 left over; and by 7, 2 are left over. How many things are there?

## Solution

### 中文版本

1. 计算3和5的最小公倍数，结果为 15.
2. 遍历自然数 m，使 15m % 7 = 1. 当 m = 1 时，15 % 7 = 1，满足条件，所以 m = 1.
3. 计算3和7的最小公倍数，结果为 21.
4. 遍历自然数 n，使 21n % 5 = 3. 当 n = 1 时，21 % 5 = 1，不满足条件；当 n = 2 时，`(21*2) % 5 = 2`，不满足条件；当 n = 3 时，`(21*3) % 5 = 3`，满足条件，所以 n = 3.
5. 计算5和7的最小公倍数，结果为 35.
6. 遍历自然数 k，使 35k % 3 = 2. 当 k = 1 时，35 % 3 = 2，满足条件，所以 k = 1.
7. 计算3、5和7的最小公倍数，结果为105.
8. 答案为 `(15m + 21n + 35k) % 105 = （15+21*3+35*1) % 105 = 8`

Question: There are some apples on the table. If we count them by 3, we have 2 left over; by 5, we have 3 left over; and by 7, 1 are left over. How many apples are there?
Solution:
1. Calculate the least common multiple of 3 and 5, the result is 15.
2. Iterate over natural numbers m such that 15m % 7 = 1. When m = 1, 15 % 7 = 1, which satisfies the condition. So, m = 1.
3. Calculate the least common multiple of 3 and 7, the result is 21.
4. Iterate over natural numbers n such that 21n % 5 = 3. When n = 1, (21*1) % 5 = 21 % 5 = 1, which does not satisfy the condition. When n = 2, (21*2) % 5 = 42 % 5 = 2, which does not satisfy the condition. When n = 3, (21*3) % 5 = 63 % 5 = 3, which satisfies the condition. So, n = 3.
5. Calculate the least common multiple of 5 and 7, the result is 35.
6. Iterate over natural numbers k such that 35k % 3 = 2. When k = 1, 35 % 3 = 2, which satisfies the condition. So, k = 1.
7. Calculate the least common multiple of 3, 5, and 7, the result is 105.
8. The answer is (15m + 21n + 35k) % 105 = (15+21*3+35*1) % 105 = 8.

To solve this problem, we can follow a similar approach as before.

Calculate the least common multiple of 3, 5, and 7, which is 105.
Iterate over natural numbers x such that 105x % 3 = 1. When x = 1, (1051) % 3 = 0, which does not satisfy the condition. When x = 2, (1052) % 3 = 0, which does not satisfy the condition. Continuing this process, we find that x = 35 satisfies the condition.
Iterate over natural numbers y such that 105y % 5 = 3. When y = 1, (1051) % 5 = 0, which does not satisfy the condition. When y = 2, (1052) % 5 = 0, which does not satisfy the condition. Continuing this process, we find that y = 21 satisfies the condition.
Iterate over natural numbers z such that 105z % 7 = 4. When z = 1, (1051) % 7 = 0, which does not satisfy the condition. When z = 2, (1052) % 7 = 0, which does not satisfy the condition. Continuing this process, we find that z = 15 satisfies the condition.
Finally, we can calculate the total number of items using the formula (105x + 105y + 105z) / 105, which simplifies to x + y + z. Substituting the values we found, the answer is 35 + 21 + 15 = 71.

Therefore, there are a total of 71 items on the table.

I will show you how to solve question 1 step by step. Then I will give you question 2, and you need to solve it using the method from the question 1.

Question 1: There are some apples on the table. If we count them by 3, we have 2 left over; by 5, we have 3 left over; and by 7, 1 are left over. How many apples are there?
Solution:
Step 1. Calculate the least common multiple of 3 and 5, the result is 15.
Step 2. Iterate over natural numbers m such that (15*m) % 7 = 1 (since 1 are left over by 7). When m = 1, (15*1) % 7 = 15 % 7 = 1, which satisfies the condition. So, m = 1.
Step 3. Calculate the least common multiple of 3 and 7, the result is 21.
Step 4. Iterate over natural numbers n such that (21*n) % 5 = 3 (since 3 are left over by 5). When n = 1, (21*1) % 5 = 21 % 5 = 1, which does not satisfy the condition. When n = 2, (21*2) % 5 = 42 % 5 = 2, which does not satisfy the condition. When n = 3, (21*3) % 5 = 3, which satisfies the condition. So, n = 3.
Step 5. Calculate the least common multiple of 5 and 7, the result is 35.
Step 6. Iterate over natural numbers k such that (35*k) % 3 = 2 (since 2 are left over by 3). When k = 1, (35*1) % 3 = 35 % 3 = 2, which satisfies the condition. So, k = 1.
Step 7. Calculate the least common multiple of 3, 5, and 7, the result is 105.
Step 8. The answer is (15*m + 21*n + 35*k) % 105 = (15+21*3+35*1) % 105 = (15+63+35) % 105 = 113 % 105 = 8.

Question 2: There are some apples on the table. If we count them by 3, we have 1 left over; by 5, we have 4 left over; and by 7, 2 are left over. How many apples are there?

To solve question 2 using the method from question 1, follow these steps:

Step 1. Calculate the least common multiple of 3 and 5. The LCM of 3 and 5 is 15.

Step 2. Iterate over natural numbers m such that (15 * m) % 7 = 2 (since 2 are left over by 7). Find the smallest value of m that satisfies this condition.

When m = 1, (15 * 1) % 7 = 15 % 7 = 1, which does not satisfy the condition.
When m = 2, (15 * 2) % 7 = 30 % 7 = 2, which satisfies the condition. So, m = 2.

Step 3. Calculate the least common multiple of 3 and 7. The LCM of 3 and 7 is 21.

Step 4. Iterate over natural numbers n such that (21 * n) % 5 = 4 (since 4 are left over by 5). Find the smallest value of n that satisfies this condition.

When n = 1, (21 * 1) % 5 = 21 % 5 = 1, which does not satisfy the condition.
When n = 2, (21 * 2) % 5 = 42 % 5 = 2, which does not satisfy the condition.
When n = 3, (21 * 3) % 5 = 63 % 5 = 3, which does not satisfy the condition.
When n = 4, (21 * 4) % 5 = 84 % 5 = 4, which satisfies the condition. So, n = 4.

Step 5. Calculate the least common multiple of 5 and 7. The LCM of 5 and 7 is 35.

Step 6. Iterate over natural numbers k such that (35 * k) % 3 = 1 (since 1 is left over by 3). Find the smallest value of k that satisfies this condition.

When k = 1, (35 * 1) % 3 = 35 % 3 = 2, which does not satisfy the condition.
When k = 2, (35 * 2) % 3 = 70 % 3 = 2, which does not satisfy the condition.
When k = 3, (35 * 3) % 3 = 105 % 3 = 0, which satisfies the condition. So, k = 3.

Step 7. Calculate the least common multiple of 3, 5, and 7. The LCM of 3, 5, and 7 is 105.

Step 8. The answer is (15 * m + 21 * n + 35 * k) % 105 = (15 * 2 + 21 * 4 + 35 * 3) % 105 = (30 + 84 + 105) % 105 = 219 % 105 = 9.

Therefore, there are 9 apples on the table.
